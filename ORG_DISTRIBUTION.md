# Organization distribution

This repository is the canonical organization-wide skill library for
The Interdependency.

## Canonical source

All organization-level agent skill edits should happen here first.

Repo-local copies may exist under:

```text
.agents/skills/
```

Propagation PRs should cite this repository and the source commit SHA.

## Target repos

**Active vendoring consumers** — carry a top-level `.agents/skills/<skill>/`
subset copied from here. These are exactly the repos the scheduled drift
detector (`.github/workflows/consumer-drift.yml`) checks:

* `The-Interdependency/a0`
* `The-Interdependency/ucns`
* `The-Interdependency/edcm`
* `The-Interdependency/interdependent-lib`
* `The-Interdependency/aimmh`
* `The-Interdependency/ai-tiw`
* `The-Interdependency/eml_ucns`
* `The-Interdependency/zfae`
* `The-Interdependency/pcea`
* `The-Interdependency/a0-betatest`
* `The-Interdependency/metapat`
* `The-Interdependency/ptcna`
* `The-Interdependency/pubskill-lib`
* `The-Interdependency/epac`
* `The-Interdependency/stack`

**Targets not in the drift matrix** (do not vendor a top-level subset yet, so
`--require-vendored` would fail them):

* `The-Interdependency/a0ucns` — an aggregator that embeds whole copies of other
  repos rather than vendoring a top-level `.agents/skills/` subset. Its nested
  embeds carry their own copies; re-sync those from their source repos.

**Archived or superseded** — not active drift consumers:

* `The-Interdependency/edcmbone` — archived; maintained EDCM work lives in `edcm`
* `The-Interdependency/PTCA`, `The-Interdependency/pcna` (→ `ptcna`)

Add a repo to the active list — and the drift matrix — once it carries a
canonical `.agents/skills/` subset.

## Collection points

Every consuming repo should eventually carry a root collection point:

```text
<reponame>_msdmd.ts
```

Use `python -m msdmd.collect --root . --repo <repo> --out <reponame>_msdmd.ts`
when the repo can run the collector locally. A provisional hand-seeded collection
point is allowed only when it records a `hmmm` gap explaining what local
generation still needs.

`skill-lib_msdmd.ts` is the root collection point for this canonical repo.

## Propagation checklist

Use `docs/propagation-checklist.md` for the concrete source-change →
target-repo PR sequence. Use `docs/runner-config-guidance.md` before judging
large or artifact-heavy repos; frozen research artifacts, archives, generated
trees, and vendored `.agents/skills/` copies should not pollute the denominator.

## Rule

Before assigning a stack-level task to one repository, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/interdependent-work-graph/SKILL.md
```

Resolve the exact participating repository and evidence-source identities first. Repository boundaries remain authority and provenance boundaries, not agent-attention boundaries.

Before changing the structure of `The-Interdependency/stack` — including participant,
pin, authority, relation, workspace, BASE, extraction/graduation, or architecture
projections — agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/stack-update/SKILL.md
```

Load `interdependent-work-graph` with it. Treat the mutation as one coherent
transaction: update every affected authority/provenance projection, remove superseded
claims, recompute the work-graph digest, and require the stack consistency checker to
pass before merge.

Before deciding whether a component born inside a stack, integration, laboratory, or incubator repository should become an independent repository/package, or before extracting, publishing, reconsuming, or declaring such a component graduated, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/project-incubation-graduation/SKILL.md
```

Load `interdependent-work-graph` once the transition crosses repository boundaries. Graduation transfers implementation/public-contract authority only after qualification, release, and downstream reconsumption; it does not transfer semantic, proof, theorem, measurement, certification, or empirical status.

Before assembling one textbook, report, standard, corpus, archive, or public reading sequence from source-owned units distributed across repositories or independently owned files, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/distributed-publication/SKILL.md
```

Load `interdependent-work-graph` with it. Preserve ordered source identity, source-local licenses and statuses, correction routing, fail-closed production retrieval, explicit fallback, static reading access, and provenance in the published build artifact.

Before creating a new module, route, service, adapter, schema, worker,
engine, UI panel, migration, or experiment, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/meta-module-build/SKILL.md
```

New module work should start with a `MODULE_BUILD` block. Unknown fields
must be marked `hmmm`, not guessed.

Before creating or maintaining a root `llms.txt`, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/llms-build/SKILL.md
```

Root LLM instructions should be declared in source `LLMS` blocks and generated
with the llms-build runner, not hand-maintained as separate doctrine.

Before translating raw, recursive, context-heavy, fragmentary, coined, or
private-language thought for another human audience or public surface, agents
should read:

```text
.agents/skills/thought-lens/SKILL.md
```

Recover and freeze the claim kernel before changing vocabulary. Reduce the
context required from the reader without strengthening, flattening, or silently
completing the thought; use `hmmm` where a bridge remains unresolved. Use
`plain-lens` instead when the source is already a stable dense document.

Before promoting a word or phrase into canon, a theorem, schema, ontology, encoding,
or other semantic control surface, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/domain-claims/SKILL.md
```

Establish the applicable domain-qualified sense and resolve collisions before
attaching provenance or authorizing structure.

Before constructing, reviewing, replaying, or extending UCNS gonols, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/gonol-build/SKILL.md
```

Resolve the current UCNS source and evidence identities first. Preserve closure and
atomic promotion, require explicit occurrence-addressed function plans, and do not
restore the superseded `gonal-morphology` language model.

Before selecting among UCNS options or declaring a scoped winner, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/ucns-option-selection/SKILL.md
```

Freeze scope, candidates, hard gates, evidence, policies, authority, and
ratification before outcome comparison. Do not let scores compensate for failed gates
or transfer a scoped result into universal UCNS canon.

Before selecting an EPAC artifact and representation for a human-facing or
WebMCP display, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/epac-selection-display/SKILL.md
```

Pin the provisional EPAC source, exact target, receipt, and available renderer;
preserve research standings, nonclaims, sealed-comparison boundaries, and `hmmm`;
and keep the WebMCP server a read-only registry/handoff rather than an EPAC
executor.

Before choosing between the smallest decisive action and a maximal coherent program,
selecting the highest-leverage next step under constrained time, attention, money,
compute, or coordination, or deciding whether a bounded falsifier should precede a
full build, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/action-calibration/SKILL.md
```

Name the decision, preserve load-bearing invariants, compare complete cost vectors,
freeze outcome-conditioned escalation rules, and let `loop-eng` execute the selected
bounded loop.

Before auditing or auditing and repairing an existing repository, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/repo-audit-repair/SKILL.md
```

Resolve exact repository identity and authority first; select checks from actual
repository claims; classify defects separately from environment, external service,
policy, and `hmmm`; repair only the owning layer under the user's authorization; and
verify merge, release, and deployment as distinct terminal states when applicable.

Before writing, reviewing, or troubleshooting repeatable SSH automation or a
large terminal paste that contains SSH, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/ssh-automation/SKILL.md
```

Fail closed on endpoint identity and host-key trust, preserve local/remote shell
boundaries, and keep bulk pasted error handling inside a child shell.

Before giving an MCP-capable agent operational contact with a private VM, agents should read:

```text
.agents/skills/vm-mcp/SKILL.md
```

Keep SSH/OS Login credentials outside the model path, install the service loopback-only and non-root, establish private authenticated transport, prove read-only contact before enabling shell execution, and add privileged administration only as named bounded capabilities rather than a generic root shell.

Existing files are not retroactively noncompliant merely because they predate
this skill.

## hmmm

Target-repo propagation is not complete just because `skill-lib` is updated.
Each target repo still needs a repo-local propagation PR, source commit SHA,
collection point, and local verification record.
